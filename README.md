README: Breast Cancer Diagnosis Using Machine Learning
Project Overview
This project focuses on developing machine learning models to classify breast cancer as benign or malignant using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset. The models explored include Random Forest, XGBoost, and Deep Neural Networks (DNN). This repository includes the code, data preprocessing steps, and results analysis necessary for reproducibility.
